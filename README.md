# BLDC and ESC

This project is still in progress! 

The objective of this project is to design and build a 3D printed motor. For this project, I chose to build a brushless DC motor due to the complex nature of its drive circuitry. I felt this would make a great project to learn about power electronics and motors. 

So far, I've designed the stator and stator mount for the motor. I am going to print both pieces soon with PLA in my home 3D printer to make sure both pieces fit.

The rest of mechanical design process is going to be as follows:
- Print the stator and stator mount from PLA to ensure that they fit together.
- Design and print the rotor and ensure that it fits properly with the magnets and shaft collars.
- Print the stator from iron ferromagnetic PLA.
- Print the rotor and stator mount from PETG to ensure rigidity.
- Wind the magnet wire around the stator in a Y configuration.
- Insert the magnets and glue any parts that need it.

To test the motor, I'm going to be using an off the shelf ESC for BLDC motors. I aim to identify the maximum torque, power, rpm and voltage/current ratings for the motor.

I will continue to design a PCB layout for my own ESC and then print and assemble the ESC, and retest the motor with new ESC.

I hope to CNC the parts soon, to improve performance. I plan on having the stator made from feromagnetic steel sheets, and the stator mount and rotor made from steel as well.

I am curious to see how powerful of a motor that I can build at home without industrial tools.

In this GitHub you can keep track of my progress!
