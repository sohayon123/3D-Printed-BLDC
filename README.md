# BLDC

This project is still in progress! 

The objective of this project is to design and build a 3D printed motor. For this project, I chose to build a brushless DC motor due to the complex nature of its drive circuitry. I felt this would make a great project to learn about power electronics and motors. 

I've designed version 1 of this motor and 3D printed it with PETG and iron infused PLA (for increased flux density). I winded 20 gauge magnet wire around the stator in a Y configuration and inserted and glued the neodymium magnets and bearings/shaft collars.
